Simple React.js + Typescript app that simulates a virtual wallet, allowing the user to see their purchases, the payment methods, who made the purchase (if not the user) and the total cost. 
It also implements a simple points balance, which depends on the current season.

To run it, simply clone the repository locally, install dependencies using 'npm install', and then run using 'npm start'.
